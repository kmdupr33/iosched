Unit Testable Fork of Google's I/O Android App
======================

This project is an attempt to refactor Google's IO app so that it is unit testable. I say a little bit about why I want to do this [here](http://www.philosophicalhacker.com/2015/05/31/towards-a-unit-testable-fork-of-googles-iosched-app/)
